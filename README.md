<p><h3>An advanced game-engine for creating advanced text-based games in the terminal.</h3></p>

## Welcome!
Many text-based terminal games, like Snake, are undeniably cool, but coding them from scratch can be a real challenge. That's where Quartz Engine steps in! Originally created in May of 2022, the initial version aimed to simplify this process. However, it fell short with a clunky design and limited support for creating Worlds and other essential features. This rewrite is a fresh start, designed to be easier to use and far more enjoyable than the buggy mess it used to be.
